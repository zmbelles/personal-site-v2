This component is then fed into the BlogPosts.vue component where all of the blog posts are bundled together with scoped styling and then data is emitted to the BlogPage.vue component that uses a v-for statement to loop through all of the posts and display them on the page. The posts themselves are currently locally stored on a db.json file using json-server and fetching the data with CRUD calls but will be migrated to another API/CDN later on.",
